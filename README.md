# RecommendationWidget-
Add a basic recommendation widget in your e-commerce using JavaScript.


Overview

In this imaginary scenario, a clothing retailer has come to us to learn more
about our product recommendations. You want to show the prospect what recommendations might look
like when live on their site, so you build a small custom demo that showcases a recommendation widget
on their product page.

Requirements

Your project submission should be composed of a single code block, that, when copied and pasted into the
browser console and run on the reference page, renders a recommendations widget satisfying the following
requirements:
1) The recommendations widget should be inserted underneath the product information on this
reference page: https://demostore.x-cart.com/fashion/clothing/oversized-hoodie-in-grey.
2) The widget should have slots for 6 products, but show only 3 slots at a time, with page scrolling
functionality to cycle through the slots. The scrolling should occur via clicking on the left/right
arrows.
3) The products chosen do not matter (they can be fake products or pulled in from existing products
on the site), and you can hardcode the products into the slots, if needed.
4) You must use Javascript to implement the scroll functionality.
In order to keep your code clean, feel free to decompose it into encapsulated functions, or even your own
files, if desired. The main requirement is that your main submission must be pasteable into the console, and
any linked code/files must be accessible for us to review. A visual mockup of the general expected location
and functionality of the recommendations widget is included below.
